# Hello, I'm Liam!

I have a strong passion for software development, robotics, microcontrollers, and mechatronics.

I'm currently a second-year Computer Science student with expertise in Java, Python, and various other frameworks showcased in my portfolio.

As part of a team of four, we proudly secured the **Runner-Up** position at the Hack Ireland Hackathon with our project *[Neutralize](https://github.com/RobbyLinson/Hack-Ireland---Group-11)*.
